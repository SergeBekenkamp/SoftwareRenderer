# SoftwareRenderer

A renderer based on [this](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/davrous/2013/06/13/tutorial-series-learning-how-to-write-a-3d-soft-engine-from-scratch-in-c-typescript-or-javascript/) tutorial but written in (badly) coded c++

I Started this to screw around in c++ and just to see how far i could get.

Any help with code refactoring and other stuff is appreciated
